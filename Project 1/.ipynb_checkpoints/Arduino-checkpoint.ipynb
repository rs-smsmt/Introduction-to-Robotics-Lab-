    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In the <span style=\"color:#E0115F\">Arduino</span>o 4-Bit Counter with LEDs project, you will work with current-limiting resistors, specifically 300-ohm resistors. These resistors play a crucial role in ensuring the proper operation and longevity of the LEDs in your circuit. Let's explore why current-limiting resistors are important:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align:justify;margin-bottom:8px;\"><strong>Protection against Overcurrent:</strong> LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are diodes that emit light when a current passes through them. However, they are sensitive components and can be easily damaged by excessive current. Current-limiting resistors help control the amount of current that flows through the LED, preventing damage.</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align:justify;margin-bottom:8px;\"><strong>Voltage-Current Relationship:</strong> Using a specific resistance value, such as the 300-ohm resistor in this project, you can calculate and limit the current flowing through the LED. Ohm's Law (I = V/R) allows you to determine the current (I) by dividing the voltage (V) across the resistor by its resistance (R). This ensures that the LED emits light at the desired brightness without being subjected to excessive stress.</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align:justify;margin-bottom:8px;\"><strong>Consistent LED Performance:</strong> Current-limiting resistors ensure that all LEDs in your circuit operate at a consistent and uniform brightness level. Variations in LED characteristics and supply voltage can lead to uneven illumination without proper current regulation.</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align:justify;margin-bottom:8px;\"><strong>Prolonging LED Lifespan:</strong> By preventing overcurrent, current-limiting resistors contribute to extending the lifespan of the LEDs. LEDs operated within their specified current limits are less likely to degrade or fail prematurely, resulting in a more reliable and durable circuit.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In the <span style=\"color:#E0115F\">Arduino</span> 4-Bit Counter project, the 300-ohm current-limiting resistors are strategically placed in series with each LED to provide the appropriate current regulation. This careful consideration of resistor values showcases the importance of proper component selection and circuit design in ensuring a successful and reliable project outcome.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">By incorporating current-limiting resistors in your circuit, you're not only protecting your components but also gaining a deeper understanding of electronics and the nuances of designing functional and efficient circuits.</p>\n",

Check the serial monitor for any error messages or output to ensure the code is running without issues.</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align:justify;margin-bottom:8px;\">LED Behavior: Observe the LEDs connected to the Arduino board. They should light up according to the binary counting sequence, representing the numbers from 0 to 15.</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align:justify;margin-bottom:8px;\">LED Sequence: Verify that the LEDs are lighting up in the correct sequence, following the binary counting pattern. This confirms the accuracy of your code and circuit connections.</li>\n",
