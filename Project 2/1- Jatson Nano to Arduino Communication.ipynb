    "<p style='text-align:justify;'>The <span style=\"color: purple;\">I2C</span> (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol is a widely used serial communication standard that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other using a common bus. It was developed by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors) and has become a fundamental method for interconnecting various components within electronic systems.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style=\"color: purple;\">I2C</span> employs a master-slave architecture, where one device, the <strong>master</strong>, initiates and controls the communication, while other devices, the <strong>slaves</strong>, respond to commands from the master. The protocol utilizes two communication lines: the <strong>SCL</strong> (Serial Clock) line and the <strong>SDA</strong> (Serial Data) line.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify;'>Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how <span style=\"color: purple;\">I2C</span> communication works:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Start Condition:</strong> The master device initiates communication by sending a start signal on the SDA line while keeping the SCL line high. This informs all devices on the bus that a communication session is beginning.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Addressing:</strong> The master sends a 7-bit address of the target slave device it wishes to communicate with, followed by a direction bit indicating whether it wants to read from or write to the slave.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> The addressed slave device that recognizes its address responds with an acknowledgment signal. If no device acknowledges, it indicates that there is no slave with the specified address.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Data Transfer:</strong> The master and slave devices exchange data in 8-bit chunks. The master sends or receives data, and after each byte, the receiver sends an acknowledgment bit.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Stop Condition:</strong> The master generates a stop signal by releasing the SDA line while keeping the SCL line high. This indicates the end of communication for the current session.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style=\"color: purple;\">I2C</span>'s simplicity, multi-device capability, and efficient use of hardware resources make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from sensor networks and displays to EEPROM memory and real-time clocks. It operates at different speeds, known as clock frequencies, allowing for flexibility based on the devices' capabilities.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify;'>Understanding the <span style=\"color: purple;\">I2C</span> protocol is crucial for implementing successful communication between the <span style=\"color: #E0115F;\">Arduino</span> and <span style=\"color: orange;\">Jetson Nano</span>.
